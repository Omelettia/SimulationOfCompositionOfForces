## Descriptions

This software allows users to simulate the motion of physical objects on a horizontal surface using MVC models

## Features

### Components

    Main Object: Users can choose between a cube-shaped or cylinder-shaped object. They can specify parameters such as side length (for cubes) or radius (for cylinders) and mass.

    Actor: Represents the force applied to the main object's center of mass. The force is visualized as a horizontal arrow, adjustable in magnitude and direction.

    Surface: The horizontal surface allows users to control static and kinetic friction coefficients, influencing the object's motion.

### Simulation Controls

    Setup: Objects are placed on the surface by dragging from a menu. Users then configure parameters via a context menu.

    Real-time Updates: Motion simulation recalculates the object's position based on applied forces and friction coefficients over time intervals.

    User Interaction: Users can adjust applied forces and surface friction coefficients during simulation.

    Control Panel: Options to pause, resume, and reset simulations are provided for user convenience.

### Display Options

    Detailed Information: Users can toggle display of:
        Forces and their sums as directional arrows.
        Object mass displayed on the object.
        Speed and acceleration values shown in the interface.

### Usage

To use the simulation:

    Drag an object onto the surface.
    Configure object parameters and apply forces.
    Adjust friction coefficients as needed.
    Monitor object motion and displayed metrics in real-time.
